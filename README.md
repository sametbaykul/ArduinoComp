# ArduinoComp
This is a C++ framework which makes easy to program different circuit components like LED's, push buttons, servo motors etc by using Arduino. But it can be used for some advanced purposes as well like building a custom serial communication protocol or a console. All components are implemented as an OOP class.

--------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

* Basic OOP
* Beginner level of Arduino
* Beginner level of C++

--------------------------------------------------
USAGE:
--------------------------------------------------

* You can use each class individually (All of them are seperate doc)
* You can try each class on Autodesk TinkerCad which is a free online circuit prototyping tool.
